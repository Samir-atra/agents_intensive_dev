> **Agents Intensive Capstone Project** - A multi-agent system for comprehensive code analysis and quality assessment

## 🎯 What is Code Broker?

Code Broker is an intelligent multi-agent system built with Google's ADK that automatically analyzes code files, directories, or GitHub repositories and generates detailed assessment reports with actionable improvement recommendations.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **Multi-Source Analysis**: Files, directories, or GitHub repositories
- 📊 **Comprehensive Scoring**: Correctness, security, style, and maintainability metrics
- 🤖 **5-Agent System**: Parallel processing with specialized AI agents
- 📝 **Beautiful Reports**: Markdown and HTML formatted assessment reports
- ⚡ **Fast & Reliable**: Async processing with retry mechanisms
- 🎨 **Pylint Integration**: Automated Python code quality analysis

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup

## 🏗️ Architecture

Code Broker uses a **hierarchical multi-agent architecture**:

- **Report Generator** (Orchestrator): Coordinates the entire workflow
- **Sequential Pipeline Agent**: Manages assessment flow
- **Parallel Assessment Agent**: Runs 3 agents concurrently:
  - Correctness Assessor
  - Style Assessor  
  - Description Generator
- **Improvement Recommender**: Synthesizes findings into actionable recommendations
